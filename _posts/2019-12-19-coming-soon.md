I finally upgraded from plain HTML  (which can still be found <a href="https://github.com/jakeprem/jakeprem.github.io/tree/0ecfc81c7ae30505b8aac226d783ece8c711a9d3" target="_blank">here</a>). I've settled on Jekyll for now, using the [Plainwhite](https://github.com/thelehhman/plainwhite-jekyll) theme with some minor customizations. There are some limitations to Jekyll and this theme, but this will give me a place to post things until I'm ready to make an upgrade. I'm currently working on two Elixir posts, including streaming XML using Elixir.
